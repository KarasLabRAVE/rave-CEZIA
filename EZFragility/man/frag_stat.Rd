\arguments{
\item{frag}{Matrix or Fragility object. Either a matrix with row as Electrode names and Column as fragility index, or a Fragility object from \code{calc_adj_frag}}

\item{elecsoz}{Integer.  Vector soz electrodes (for good electrodes)}
}
\value{
list of 5 items with quantile matrix, mean and sdv from both electrodes groups
}

}
\examples{
data("pt01Frag")
data("pt01Epoch")
sozindex<-attr(pt01Epoch,"sozindex")
