\title{Compute quantiles, mean and standard deviation for two electrodes group marked as soz non marked as soz}
\usage{
fragStat(frag, sozID)
}
\arguments{
\item{frag}{Matrix or Fragility object. Either a matrix with row as Electrode names and Column as fragility index, or a Fragility object from \code{calcAdjFrag}}

\item{sozID}{Integer.  Vector soz electrodes (for good electrodes)}
}
\value{
list of 5 items with quantile matrix, mean and sdv from both electrodes groups
}
\description{

}
\examples{
data("pt01Frag")
data("pt01EcoG")
sozindex <- attr(pt01EcoG, "sozindex")
pt01fragstat <- fragStat(frag = pt01Frag, sozID = sozindex)
