This is the introduction to how to use the EZFragility package.
It calculates the neural fragility heatmap based on intracranial electrocorticographic (iEEG) recordings of ictal events.
The method is based on the paper by Li et al. (2017) <doi: 10.23919/ACC.2017.7963378>.

## Load small ictal ieeg data for patient PT01

This example data corresponds to the first seizure of patient PT01 from the Fragility Data Set. `pt01EcoG` is a matrix with 300 rows (time points) and 84 columns (electrodes). The rows names are the electrodes names. The column names is the time relative to seizure onset in (s). For more information about the data, you can use the `?pt01EcoG` command.

The patient underwent a surgical treatment and was seizure-free after the surgery. The electrodes located in the surgically removed area are marked in `sozIndex` attribute.
```{r ictal data}
data("pt01EcoG")
## create an epoch object
epoch <- Epoch(pt01EcoG)
epoch
```

The function `visuIEEGData` can visualize the iEEG data. 
```{r}
visuIEEGData(epoch  = epoch)
```

The Epoch object can be subset using the `[` operator.
```{r}
# The electrode names corresponding to the site of the patient's surgery
sozNames <- attr(pt01EcoG, "sozNames")

## Show the electrodes that are marked as SOZ and additional 4 electrodes
display <- c(sozNames, "MLT1", "MLT2", "MLT3", "MLT4")
visuIEEGData(epoch  = epoch[display])
## Equivalent to: 
## visuIEEGData(epoch  = epoch[display, ])

## constrain to the first 100 time points
visuIEEGData(epoch  = epoch[display, 1:100])
```

You can use `truncateTime` to specify the time range
```{r}
epochClipped <- truncateTime(epoch, from = -1, to = 0)

visuIEEGData(epoch  = epochClipped)
```

## Compute Fragility Matrix
The function `calcAdjFrag` computes the fragility matrix for the given iEEG time series. The simplest form is `calcAdjFrag(ieegts, window, step)`. However, computing Fragility Matrix can take a bit while. To speed up the computation, we provided a parallel example below. The parallel feature is built upon the `foreach` package. You need to have a parallel backend registered in your R session beforehand. For example, you can use the `doSNOW` package to register a parallel backend.
```{r}
## Register a SNOW parallel backend with 4 workers
library(doSNOW)
cl <- makeCluster(4, type = "SOCK")
registerDoSNOW(cl)

windowNum <- 250
step <- 125
pt01Frag <- calcAdjFrag(epoch = epoch, window = windowNum, step = step, parallel = TRUE, progress = TRUE)

# Fragility result
pt01Frag

# Stop the parallel backend
stopCluster(cl)
```


## Plot functions for Fragility Matrix
The function `plotFragHeatmap` can reproduce Patient 01 results Figure 4 a from Li et al. paper. Time window around seizure onset [-1:2]s, which includes the following electrodes: 

- Seizure Onset Electrodes within the surgery region: `sozName`
- Non seizure Onset Electrodes outside of the surgery region: "MLT1", "MLT2", "MLT3", "MLT4" 

The parameter `sozIndex` accepts either electrode names or their indices in the fragility matrix. If `sozIndex` is provided, the function will display the `sozIndex` electrodes in the top rows of the heatmap. If `sozIndex` is not provided, the function will simply generate a heatmap of the fragility matrix.
```{r}
display <- c(sozNames, "MLT1", "MLT2", "MLT3", "MLT4")
plotFragHeatmap(frag = pt01Frag[display], sozIndex = sozNames)
```

`plotFragDistribution` and `plotFragQuantile` are similar to the `plotFragHeatmap` function. They plot the fragility distribution and quantiles, respectively.
```{r, out.width="100%"}
plotFragDistribution(frag = pt01Frag[display], sozIndex = sozNames)
```

```{r, out.width="100%"}
plotFragQuantile(frag = pt01Frag[display], sozIndex = sozNames)
```
