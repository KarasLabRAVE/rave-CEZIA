This is the introduction to how to use the EZFragility package.
It calculates the neural fragility heatmap based on intracranial electrocorticographic (iEEG) recordings of ictal events.
The method is based on the paper by Li et al. (2017) <doi: 10.23919/ACC.2017.7963378>.

## Key definition

Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) is a significant clinical challenge. Effective treatment requires the synthesis of large amounts of personalized clinical data with the goal of identifying the region within a patient’s brain from which seizures originate (the epileptogenic zone, or EZ). Current standard of care involves multidisciplinary group meetings and clinician consensus after reviewing patient data. This lack of a standardized methodology has led to variable surgical outcomes, measured by seizure freedom/reduction after surgery. Computational methods to identify the EZ have been developed to improve outcomes. 
The neural fragility implemented is the R package is a promising biomarker of the epileptogenic zone. We provide this R package so that the method can be tested on extensive data for research.

The hypothesis of the neural fragility is that small changes in connection strengths at seizure onset zone nodes (SOZ) cause an imbalance in inhibitory and excitatory connectivity between brain regions. Then if the SOZ is perturbed, over excitation can occur manifesting in a seizure. The neural fragility marker propose a metric to evaluate when connection strength changes cause imbalance and on which electrodes.To create the fragility marker, a personalized dynamic model of the brain network from observed iEEG signals is computed in a discrete number of time windows. Then the neural fragility measures the degree network nodes are imbalanced by systematically computing the minimum perturbation required for each electrode’s connections to produce instability for the entire network. 


## Load small ictal ieeg data for patient PT01

This example data corresponds to the first seizure of patient PT01 from the Fragility Data Set. `pt01EcoG` is a matrix with 300 rows (time points) and 84 columns (electrodes). The rows names are the electrodes names. The column names is the time relative to seizure onset in (s). For more information about the data, you can use the `?pt01EcoG` command.

The patient underwent a surgical treatment and was seizure-free after the surgery. The electrodes located in the surgically removed area are marked in `sozIndex` attribute.
```{r ictal data}
data("pt01EcoG")

## create an epoch object
epoch <- Epoch(pt01EcoG)
epoch
```

The function `visuIEEGData` can visualize the iEEG data. 
```{r}
visuIEEGData(epoch  = epoch)
```

The Epoch object can be subset using the `[` operator.
```{r}
# The electrode names corresponding to the site of the patient's surgery
sozNames <- attr(pt01EcoG, "sozNames")

## Show the electrodes that are marked as SOZ and additional 4 electrodes
display <- c(sozNames, "MLT1", "MLT2", "MLT3", "MLT4")
visuIEEGData(epoch  = epoch[display])

## Equivalent to: 
## visuIEEGData(epoch  = epoch[display, ])

## constrain to the first 100 time points
visuIEEGData(epoch  = epoch[display, 1:100])
```

You can use `truncateTime` to specify the time range
```{r}
epochClipped <- truncateTime(epoch, from = -1, to = 0)

visuIEEGData(epoch  = epochClipped)
```

## Compute Fragility Matrix
The function `calcAdjFrag` computes the fragility matrix for the given iEEG time series. The simplest form is `calcAdjFrag(ieegts, window, step)`. However, computing Fragility Matrix can take a bit while. To speed up the computation, we provided a parallel example below. The parallel feature is built upon the `foreach` package. You need to have a parallel backend registered in your R session beforehand. For example, you can use the `doSNOW` package to register a parallel backend.
```{r}
## Register a SNOW parallel backend with 4 workers
library(doSNOW)
cl <- makeCluster(4, type = "SOCK")
registerDoSNOW(cl)

windowNum <- 250
step <- 125
pt01Frag <- calcAdjFrag(epoch = epoch, window = windowNum, step = step, parallel = TRUE, progress = TRUE)

# Fragility result
pt01Frag

# Stop the parallel backend
stopCluster(cl)
```

## Predict the SOZ (need description!)

```{r}
soz <- estimateSOZ(pt01Frag[,pt01Frag$startTimes<0])
```

## Fragility Statistics (need description!)
```{r}
sozIndex <- attr(pt01EcoG, "sozIndex")
stats <- fragStat(pt01Frag, sozIndex)
```

## Plot functions for Fragility Matrix
The function `plotFragHeatmap` can reproduce Patient 01 results Figure 4 a from Li et al. paper. Time window around seizure onset [-1:2]s, which includes the following electrodes: 

- Electrodes within the surgery region: `sozName`
- Electrodes outside of the surgery region: "MLT1", "MLT2", "MLT3", "MLT4" 

The parameter `sozIndex` accepts either electrode names or their indices in the fragility matrix. If `sozIndex` is provided, the function will display the `sozIndex` electrodes in the top rows of the heatmap. If `sozIndex` is not provided, the function will simply generate a heatmap of the fragility matrix.
```{r}
display <- c(sozNames, "MLT1", "MLT2", "MLT3", "MLT4")
plotFragHeatmap(frag = pt01Frag, sozIndex = sozNames)
```

`plotFragDistribution` and `plotFragQuantile` are similar to the `plotFragHeatmap` function. They plot the fragility distribution and quantiles, respectively.
```{r, out.width="100%"}
plotFragDistribution(pt01Frag, sozIndex)
```

```{r, out.width="100%"}
plotFragQuantile(pt01Frag, sozIndex = sozNames)
```
