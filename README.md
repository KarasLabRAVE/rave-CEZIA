# rave-CEZIA

RAVE-CEZIA is a set of standalone R packages (EZFragility, EZPLHG) to compute automatic epileptogenic zone localization.
The packages have an Rmarkdown which show how to run the package on a small patient data.
The Rmarkdown is in vignettes and can be found with help(package="EZ*")


Its overaching goal is to use machine learning techniques to combine results from diverse epileptogenic zone identification algorithms 
to improve the accuracy and robustness of seizure localization
