# rave-CEZIA

RAVE-CEZIA is a set of standalone R packages (EZFragility, EZPLHG) to compute automatic epileptogenic zone localization.
Its overaching goal is to use machine learning techniques to combine results from diverse epileptogenic zone identification algorithms 
to improve the accuracy and robustness of seizure localization
